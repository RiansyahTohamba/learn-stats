In particular,\\n    it tests whether the distribution of the differences x - y is symmetric\\n    about zero. It is a non-parametric version of the paired T-test.\\n\\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    x : array_like\\n        Either the first set of measurements (in which case `y` is the second\\n        set of measurements), or the differences between two sets of\\n        measurements (in which case `y` is not to be specified.)  Must be\\n        one-dimensional.\\n    y : array_like, optional\\n        Either the second set of measurements (if `x` is the first set of\\n        measurements), or not specified (if `x` is the differences between\\n        two sets of measurements.)  Must be one-dimensional.\\n    zero_method : {\\'pratt\\', \\'wilcox\\', \\'zsplit\\'}, optional\\n        The following options are available (default is \\'wilcox\\'):\\n     \\n          * \\'pratt\\': Includes zero-differences in the ranking process,\\n            but drops the ranks of the zeros, see [4]_, (more conservative).\\n          * \\'wilcox\\': Discards all zero-differences, the default.\\n          * \\'zsplit\\': Includes zero-differences in the ranking process and \\n            split the zero rank between positive and negative ones.\\n    correction : bool, optional\\n        If True, apply continuity correction by adjusting the Wilcoxon rank\\n        statistic by 0.5 towards the mean value when computing the\\n        z-statistic.  Default is False.\\n    alternative : {\"two-sided\", \"greater\", \"less\"}, optional\\n        The alternative hypothesis to be tested, see Notes.

One assumption of the test\\n    is that the differences are symmetric, see [2]_.\\n    The two-sided test has the null hypothesis that the median of the\\n    differences is zero against the alternative that it is different from\\n    zero. The one-sided test has the null hypothesis that the median is \\n    positive against the alternative that it is negative \\n    (``alternative == \\'less\\'``), or vice versa (``alternative == \\'greater.\\'``).\\n\\n    The test uses a normal approximation to derive the p-value (if\\n    ``zero_method == \\'pratt\\'``, the approximation is adjusted as in [5]_).\\n    A typical rule is to require that n > 20 ([2]_, p. 383).
