    Calculate the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

    The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests the null hypothesis that two
    related paired samples come from the same distribution. In particular,
    it tests whether the distribution of the differences x - y is symmetric
    about zero. It is a non-parametric version of the paired T-test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Either the first set of measurements (in which case `y` is the second
        set of measurements), or the differences between two sets of
        measurements (in which case `y` is not to be specified.)  Must be
        one-dimensional.
    y : array_like, optional
        Either the second set of measurements (if `x` is the first set of
        measurements), or not specified (if `x` is the differences between
        two sets of measurements.)  Must be one-dimensional.
    zero_method : {'pratt', 'wilcox', 'zsplit'}, optional
        The following options are available (default is 'wilcox'):
     
          * 'pratt': Includes zero-differences in the ranking process,
            but drops the ranks of the zeros, see [4]_, (more conservative).
          * 'wilcox': Discards all zero-differences, the default.
          * 'zsplit': Includes zero-differences in the ranking process and 
            split the zero rank between positive and negative ones.
    correction : bool, optional
        If True, apply continuity correction by adjusting the Wilcoxon rank
        statistic by 0.5 towards the mean value when computing the
        z-statistic.  Default is False.
    alternative : {"two-sided", "greater", "less"}, optional
        The alternative hypothesis to be tested, see Notes. Default is
        "two-sided".

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        If `alternative` is "two-sided", the sum of the ranks of the
        differences above or below zero, whichever is smaller.
        Otherwise the sum of the ranks of the differences above zero.
    pvalue : float
        The p-value for the test depending on `alternative`.

    Notes
    -----
    The test has been introduced in [4]_. Given n independent samples
    (xi, yi) from a bivariate distribution (i.e. paired samples),
    it computes the differences di = xi - yi. One assumption of the test
    is that the differences are symmetric, see [2]_.
    The two-sided test has the null hypothesis that the median of the
    differences is zero against the alternative that it is different from
    zero. The one-sided test has the null hypothesis that the median is 
    positive against the alternative that it is negative 
    (``alternative == 'less'``), or vice versa (``alternative == 'greater.'``).

    The test uses a normal approximation to derive the p-value (if
    ``zero_method == 'pratt'``, the approximation is adjusted as in [5]_).
    A typical rule is to require that n > 20 ([2]_, p. 383). For smaller n,
    exact tables can be used to find critical values.

    Examples
    --------
    In [4]_, the differences in height between cross- and self-fertilized
    corn plants is given as follows:

    >>> d = [6, 8, 14, 16, 23, 24, 28, 29, 41, -48, 49, 56, 60, -67, 75]

    Cross-fertilized plants appear to be be higher. To test the null
    hypothesis that there is no height difference, we can apply the
    two-sided test:

    >>> from scipy.stats import wilcoxon
    >>> w, p = wilcoxon(d)
    >>> w, p
    (24.0, 0.04088813291185591)

    Hence, we would reject the null hypothesis at a confidence level of 5%,
    concluding that there is a difference in height between the groups.
    To confirm that the median of the differences can be assumed to be
    positive, we use:

    >>> w, p = wilcoxon(d, alternative='greater')
    >>> w, p
    (96.0, 0.020444066455927955)

    This shows that the null hypothesis that the median is negative can be
    rejected at a confidence level of 5% in favor of the alternative that
    the median is greater than zero. The p-value based on the approximation
    is within the range of 0.019 and 0.054 given in [2]_.
    Note that the statistic changed to 96 in the one-sided case (the sum
    of ranks of positive differences) whereas it is 24 in the two-sided
    case (the minimum of sum of ranks above and below zero).
